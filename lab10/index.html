        Hello, my name is Camille Steiger and I am currently studying at Syracuse University in Syracuse, New York. I am majoring in advertising in the Newhouse school of public communications and minoring in information management & technology in the ischool. 

        For my future career I hope that I am able to be creative and strategic by applying my skills to any company or brand I work with. I will also be able to use my knowledge with the internet and computers within my career considering online technology is only progressing. 
        
        A few personal skills that would be apparent as an employee is my high level of curiosity. I am always willing to learn more and progress my own skills. I also am very consistent with my work ethic. Once I start a project or am assigned a task, I am eager to work hard at it and put in my best effort until it is completed. 
        
        My personal hobbies and interests are very important to me when I am not working or studying. I love spending time with my friends and family. I love to ski in the winter, and go to the beach in the summer. I live on the east coast so I am able to get the best of both worlds just in a few hour car ride. At school, I am a part of a few on campus magazines where I help out with some of their graphic design projects and their social media. I have two dogs that I am obsessed with and miss very much while I am at college. I also love to travel and am so excited to go abroad next year for my second semester of my Junior year. I also plan on consistently traveling in my life outside of school.
