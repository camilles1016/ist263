            <h2>The Last Goodbye by ODESZA and Bettye LaVette</h2>
            <p>This song was ODESZA's first release after a four year silence since their last album A Moment Apart. This song is a perfect house/EDM tune that has a really good beat drop and is perfect to dance to.

            <h2>death wish by ROLE MODEL</h2>
            <p>ROLE MODEL's song was released in September of 2021. This song was released as a single and is different to most of his other tracks. It is a bit more depressing and “real”.</p>

            <h2>Blow The Roof by Louis The Child, Kasbo, and EVAN GIIA</h2>
            <p>Louis The Child is not only one of my favorite artists but EVAN GIIA is also a fan favorite. Her voice can match perfectly to Louis The Child and Kasbo's great beats. This song is a perfect, happy song and features great artists.</p>

            <h2>Invincible by Omar Apollo and Daniel Caesar</h2>
            <p>Daniel Caesar being one of my favorite R&B artists releases a new song with Omar Apollo.
                Both these artist are a staple and never go wrong.</p>

            <h2>I Hate U by SZA</h2>
            <p>This song started on TikTok before it was released. A line in the chorus became overplayed before I had even heard the full song. When the song was released I fell back in love. SZA is such a favorite and never fails.</p>

            <h2>AMAZING by Rex Orange County</h2>
            <p>Rex Orange County has a soft spot in my heart. All their songs give me such comfort and I feel as though I could listen to him at any time of day. This song Is their first single since their last release in 2017.</p>

            <h2>Don't Forget My Love by Diplo and Miguel</h2>
            <p>This is Diplo's first solo album release in 18 years. I think the match of Diplo and Miguel is a
                perfect mix of house and R&B.</p>
